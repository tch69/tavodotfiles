Hey there!

This is what I use on my crappy PC. dwm with some basic configurations.

There is preview_<whatever-date>.png there just in case you wana see what this
actually looks like.

This repo used to only contain my dotfiles. dwm, st, dwmblocks, etc used to
have their own repo instead. However, due to it being inconvenient as fuck. I
merged them into this repo. Those repos are now archived and will be deleted
soon. But of course, I don't know when I'll actually do that.

Also, please suggest me something to replace Roboto Mono. I don't hate that
font, but I've been using it for well over 3 years now and it's time to change.
