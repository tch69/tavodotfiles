dwm - dynamic window manager
============================
dwm is an extremely fast, small, and dynamic window manager for X.

This is my personal build of dwm, with my colorscheme, keybinds and these patches:
- alpha
- attachbelow
- bar height (spacing)
- cool autostart
- fullgaps
- swallow

Installation
------------
By default, this build installs dwm into ~/.local/bin. Using superuser rights here
is not recommended.

To build and install this build, issue the following commands:

	make clean
	make
	make install

Running dwm
-----------
Add the following line to your .xinitrc to start dwm using startx:

    exec dwm

In order to connect dwm to a specific display, make sure that
the DISPLAY environment variable is set correctly, e.g.:

    DISPLAY=foo.bar:1 exec dwm

(This will start dwm on display :1 of the host foo.bar.)

In order to display status info in the bar, you can do something
like this in your .xinitrc:

    while xsetroot -name "`date` `uptime | sed 's/.*,//'`"
    do
    	sleep 1
    done &
    exec dwm
